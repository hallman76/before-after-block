This repository is a Wordpress plugin that demonstrates the moving parts needed to create a custom Gutenberg block. 

Gutenberg development changed a lot throughout the year and I found many tutorials to be out-of-date or just bad. So hopefully this will be helpful in getting better practices out there. And maybe it will soon be out of date too! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The block is a basic before/after image slider based on [this before/after](https://github.com/ArekPastuszka/before-after) library. Thank you, Arkadiusz Pastuszka, for sharing your work.
